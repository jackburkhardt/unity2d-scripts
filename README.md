# unity2d-scripts
Personal scripts for my Unity2D projects. These were made in roughly 6 hours and as such are probably not suitable for production use!

Coming soon (aka tomorrow):
- Parallax camera movement
- Optional deadzone support for camera
- Better support for various types of movement (sliding, crouching, etc)
- Better interaction between objects
- Adjust handling of corners and "slipperiness" of controls

Here's a gif of the first version in action. Object collision handling is coming later!
